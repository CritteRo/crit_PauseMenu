# crit_PauseMenu - A better NUI pause menu.

---

## Heyo! :wave:

Since I liked the look of the UI that I made for my Busted! Minigame, I decided to release it as a standalone Pause Menu, for free.

## Features:

📷 Configurable Social Panel: You can add links to all your social media pages / webpages.
🗺️ Live-map Panel: Probably the only menu that tries to replicate the vanilla GTA Map panel. In here, I am using the bigmap scaleform, so if you have that deleted somehow… don’t :slight_smile: .
📌 Configurable Info Panel: Information panel that can be populated with text / image / title components from the config. HTML code can also be added in the config, if you want that.
📋 Integrated Player List Panel: There is a player list panel as well, giving you 6 text columns (ID, PlayerName and 4 configurable data columns).
🛠️ Seemless transition between Settings, Gallery, R\*Editor pause menu pages and the NUI menu.
🌐 Multi-language support: You can configure multiple languages in the locales, with a default language setting. 🇦🇺 English and 🇷🇴 Romanian configured by default.
